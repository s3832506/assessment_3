  <!-- With the purpose of this website, I wanted to give users a choose-your-own adventure based storyline in which there are a variety of different options to choose from, 
    focusing on the interaction of clicking. I came up with a basic storyline in which a variety of options can be chosen from as the user progresses through the story. 
    I made sure not to make the storyline too chaotic for both the user and myself, as I did want to deter myself away from the coding aspect of the assessment. 
    I made sure to implement a variety of options to choose from to warrant multiple plays of the game.-->
